        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello World! My name is Laura, I am a Robotics Engineer and have a masters on Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
        I love to learn new things, and I've gained so much from other amazing content creators, that I've decided to give a
        little something back to the community and try to make whatever knowledge I've aquired into a more accessible format for
        everyone.
        When I'm not busy learning or teaching something, you'll probably find me running or traveling.</p>
        
        <h1>About this website</h1>
        
        <p>I bought the domain during the pandemic, the x of feb? 2020. And that was kinda it. A whole YEAR had to go by before I
        decided to actually do somethig with it. November 2021 I decided I would learn some HTML and build my own website. It
        still is pretty much a work in progress, but if you are intesrested, you can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/regurgitatedAI/regurgitatedAI.github.io/" target="_blank">here!</a> It is served
        **freely** on Github Pages.</p>
